        <h2>Welcome to BlockEscape!</h2>
        <p>The premisse of the game is to make it to the other side without getting caught!
            By pressing <u>SPACE</u> you will shoot a laser that destroys walls, but not the enemy!
            If you either loose or win and want to play again - then you need to refresh.
